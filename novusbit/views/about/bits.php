<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<br>
<strong>Rules</strong>
<p>There are some simple rules in novusbit. Our community is the driven force of the content and thus the author themselves are responsible to uphold the quality and integrity of whats written. For instance, if the last written bit states that all the story heroes were abducted by aliens, (e.g practically ending the novus) while the novus category had nothing to do with science fiction, this bit may considered spam and should be removed.</p>
<strong>How to write Bits</strong>
<p>The best thing to do is to read the novus description, sandbox and scheme through the already written bits. In this way, you'll be inspired and surely further extend the story with a great twist.</p>
<strong>Actions</strong>
<p>A novus may be closed/ended only by the original author of the novus. A bit may be removed only if it belongs to the user currently logged in AND this bit must be the last one. In case that another bit has been already entered, the bit can't be remove as this will break the story flow.</p>

<p>A novus can be appreciated, aka favorited by an registered author. If you appreciate a novus, it will appear in your personal home page, under the appreciations. Each time a new bit in entered in one of your appreciated novus, it will be marked as unread with the count of the unread bits. Once you visit the novus the uread bit count resets to zero.</p>
